# CodeClan Video Games Dashboard

In Week 5 of the CodeClan Data Analysis course, we were given a weekend homework to create an R Shiny Dashboard based on video game sales data. The dataset can only be accessed as part of the CodeClan library, which can only be accessed if you are a student or staff member of CodeClan. However, I am providing some screenshots of the finished product. I created a sidebar that allowed for selection by game developer, a line graph showing mean game sales data over time, a slider that allowed for selection by date, and further graphs underneath that could provide summary statistics for the year selected:
