# Video Games Dashboard

In Week 5 of my Data Analysis course, we were given a weekend homework to create an R Shiny Dashboard based on video game sales data. I created a sidebar that allowed for selection by game developer, a line graph showing mean game sales data over time, a slider that allowed for selection by date, and further graphs underneath that could provide summary statistics for the year selected. Screenshots are below:
